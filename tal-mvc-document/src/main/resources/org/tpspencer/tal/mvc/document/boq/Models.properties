chapter.title = Sub Structure - Models

model.prelim.0 = <Nos[model]> of model configurations used throughout the application.
model.prelim.1 = Model configurations are attached to each of the application,
model.prelim.2 = pages, windows and views and hold the attributes that the element
model.prelim.3 = has access to. A window for example has access to its own model
model.prelim.4 = configuration, the model configuration attached to the page it is
model.prelim.5 = on, and the model configuration attached to the application. 
model.prelim.6 = Model configurations may, however, be shared between these 
model.prelim.7 = elements.

model.prelim2.0 = The model configurations are quantified here in full. However,
model.prelim2.1 = in many cases due to the cascading nature of model configurations
model.prelim2.2 = attributes may be merged. For instance two windows that each 
model.prelim2.3 = have a similar attribute if placed on a page that also has a
model.prelim2.4 = similar attribute will simply share the pages version of that
model.prelim2.5 = attribute. This is particularly true of eventable attributes.
model.prelim2.6 = Thus the amount of attributes required will be lower than that
model.prelim2.7 = specified here.

model.subtitle = <Name>
model.desc.0 = 1 of <Name> model. <Description>. This model is described in the
model.desc.1 = [Specifications] document in _Spec:<Spec>_.
model.noattrs = The model has no attributes.
model.bullet = <Nos[attr]> of properties are included in this model as a minimum.
