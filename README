TAL Web explores two main ideas for creating Web Apps.

The first is a more explicit template structure that allows you to separate
the structure of content on a page, how it looks and how it behaves into
completely separate concerns. 

The second is an implementation of the MVC pattern - yes another one! My view
is that the MVC pattern is never implemented in frameworks as per the 
original MVC pattern, but has morphed into something else. TalUI (tal-oo-e)
aims to implement a more pure MVC framework.

Status: I consider this a personal project that I use to explore my ideas. 
It is not currently a goal to "finish" this project.
