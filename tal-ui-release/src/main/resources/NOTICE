Other Libraries used by Tal UI Framework.
-----------------------------------------

Refer to project POM's for versions ...

Project: commons-logging:commons-logging
License: Apache License 2.0
Notes: Not distributed with Tal UI Framework, but source is compiled against this
library and it (or a surrogate) needs to be available at run-time.

Project: org.springframework:spring
License: Apache License 2.0
Notes: Used by the tal-mvc-spring module directly. If not using Spring then the
tal-mvc-spring module should not be used. Optional use within tal-template that
does not apply if spring is not available at run time. Spring itself is not
distributed directly with this framework.

Project: org.apache.tomcat:jasper-el
License: Apache License 2.0
Notes: Optionally used in tal-template for EL Expression evaluation. Usage is not
mandatory and can be not used or replaced with another library. Is not distributed
with Tal UI Framework.

Project: com.lowagie:itext
License: Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3
Notes: Used in the documentation generation elements only. Not distributed 
directly with the Tal UI Framework.

License: Apache License 2.0
Notes: Used for the Maven Plugin module (Mojo).

In addition Tal UI Framework uses the J2EE specification APIs when used in a
Web Container. Again it does not distribute these elements, simply depends on
them being available.
